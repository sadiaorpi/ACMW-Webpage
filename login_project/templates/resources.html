        <h2>Yearly Project: "Birdbrain"</h2>
        <p>The Hummingbird Kit consists of lights, motors, and sensors which allow students to build a personally meaningful robot out of any materials; interactive livestream where people can trigger certain events to happen from computers. For example, you could make a robot's arm wave.</p>

        <h2>Outreach and Community Service Events</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Girl Scout Badges Service: Help girls in a local Girl Scout troop earn their technology badges. Requirements for such badges include making word documents, doing artwork on the computer, and constructing a website.</li>
            <li>Grade School Visits: Ask volunteers to take trips to area grade schools to educate students about the computer science field.</li>
            <li>Fundraising: Raising money or participating in individual events that charities sponsor or organizing a women-in-computing team to contribute to the success of a fund-raising activity. Events include walks for cancer, blood drives, etc. Volunteer at the local humane shelter, soup kitchen, nursing home, etc.</li>
            <li>Workshops: Hold periodic workshops for people in the community. Students can help citizens with any computer problems they may be having, or simply teach them to set up and use an email account. Additionally, students may help the unemployed or underemployed construct resumes and learn basic technology skills.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Social Events</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Binary Bracelet making: A binary bracelet making activity is a hands-on, creative way to introduce the concept of binary code in computer science. Participants use colored beads to represent 0s and 1s, encoding messages or patterns on a bracelet.</li>
            <li>"Meet the Grads night": Invite recent graduates to talk to current students in the computer science department. The graduates should be a mix of people who went to graduate school and people who started their careers right after graduation.</li>
            <li>Computer Jewelry Social: Use earring backs, beads, stringing material, glue, etc. and use old chips or motherboards to make computer-inspired jewelry.</li>
            <li>Collaborative Events: Join forces with another campus group, such as an ACM chapter, a Women in Science group, or the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) for a combined event.</li>
        </ul>
